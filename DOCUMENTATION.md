## Testfile Doc 

### -- Result --

1) SSH key needed for being able to clone Repository (!!)
  
2) ReadMe will only show up in "Git Repositories"-View in Eclipse !   
-> open and edit in Markdown Possible !  

### --- DOC ---	

#### --- Protocol ---

- brainstorming of how PIC 16F84 functions	
- thinking/research how to use JavaFX and implement a GUI	
- JC realised file-reader		
- brainstorming of how to realise a decoder	(mask or bit shift/ how to mask or bit shift)
- joint coding of simple switch-case decoder utilising bit shift (currently ignoring dont care for NOP)	

#### --- Personal Experiences / Problems ---

- agreed to attend the Lab every week to work on the simulation and be able to ask questions
- 3 meetings were about how to read the file and how to decode the instructions and how to implement a gui (what tool to use)
- P: how to structure the work (seperate tasks)
- P: how to manage all parts of the code/gui
- P: synchonising - github (had to use new repo with SSH key)
- P: visual studio code (not working for JL) Eclipse download (JC)
- P: GUI in eclipse - JavaFX (not running after downlaod in VSC, JC) (not download in EC) (WindowBuilder, download problem, 
instead of from EclipseMarcetplace, direct download worked-> SW not synchronized working -> changed to Swing)
- P: understanding details of what PC/PCL/PCLATH / Timer / Watchdog / -> what abbreviations mean/how the processes and registers work
